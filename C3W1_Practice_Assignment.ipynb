    "Welcome to the first assignment of course 3. **This is a practice assignment**, which means that the grade you receive won't count towards your final grade of the course. **However you can still submit your solutions and receive a grade along with feedback from the grader.** Before getting started take some time to read the following tips: \n",

    "\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",

    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",

    "As you can see, the word embeddings for this task seem to distinguish negative and positive meanings. However, similar words don't necessarily cluster together, since you only trained the model to analyze the overall sentiment. Notice how the smiley face is much further away from the negative words than any of the positive words are. It turns out that smiley faces are actually the most important predictors of sentiment in this dataset. Try removing them from the tweets (and consequently from the vocabulary) and see how well the model performs then. You should see quite a significant drop in performance."
